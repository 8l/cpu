Roadmap
=======

Released
--------

0.1 - Run the example program: Fibonacci sequence.

0.2 - CPU running example program on FPGA, showing Fibonacci numbers on seven segment display.

0.3 - Readable/writable memory.

0.4 - Able to load a program into instruction memory instead of having it hardcoded.

Planned
-------

0.? - Seven segment display able to display arbitrary patterns as well as numbers.  Print the word HELLO.

0.? - VGA output to monitor.

1.0 - CPU with a range of basic IO features and demo programs; tools including emulator, assembler and compiler.

Future
------

2.0 - Rewrite instruction set:
        Set flags on arithmetic instructions/loads, and branch depending on flags.

2.1 - Optimise/pipeline CPU:
        Reduce cycles per instruction.
